Jake Junior: TramTracker for Dumbphones
===========

This is a simple single PHP file website, that uses the TramTracker JSON API from Yarra Trams to display the next trams arriving at your local tram stop. 
Everything is plain HTML for dumbphones, without the need for Javascript like the official TramTracker website.
